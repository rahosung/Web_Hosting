            the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client
            side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
            dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
